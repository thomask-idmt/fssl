# Federated Semi-supervised Learning for Industrial Sound Analysis and Keyword Spotting

> Obtaining and annotating representative training data for deep
> learning-based classifiers can be both expensive and impractical in
> domains such as Industrial Sound Analysis (ISA) and Keyword Spotting
> (KWS). Furthermore, conventional techniques often rely on centralized
> servers to store training datasets, raising concerns about data
> security. We introduce a method that combines Semi-supervised and
> Federated Learning (FSSL) for classifying audio using Federated
> Averaging and FixMatch. Our findings indicate that the model's
> accuracy decreases by 30 to 50 percentage points when the labeled
> data is reduced to just 1% of its original volume using standard
> supervised federated learning. However, our proposed FSSL method
> improves accuracy by more than 25 percentage points and reaches a
> nearly perfect accuracy for an ISA dataset, making efficient use of
> unlabeled data. Furthermore, this FSSL approach proves effective even
> when data distribution is uneven and clients only label subsets of
> all target classes.
